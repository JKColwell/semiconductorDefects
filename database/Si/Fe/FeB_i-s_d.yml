    Data from a review paper, taking many measurements at a range of temperatures
    Points out DLTS is impact by capture cross section barrier heights, while EPR
    and hall affect measurements are not. Sigma's measured at T = 300 K.

  COMMENTS: "Taken from table 1 in the appendix. The table onle provides the
  majority carrier capture corss section. The majority carrier has been
  estimated from the position of the defect level. e.g. if higher than the
  intrinsic level, it is assume the majority carrier was electrons. Tdis = 400K"
